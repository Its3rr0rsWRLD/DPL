------


<p align="center">Just an easier way to make a discord bot.</p>

<h2 align="center" width="200">It's not complete yet (Adding Installer Soon!)</h2>


<h3 align="center" width="200">DPL Functions</h3>

------

## Settings

```js
settings = default;
```

Default settings are the best for overall use, and there are no other options right now.

------

## Token

```js
token = YourToken;
```

This is the token you get from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me). You can not put quotation marks around it.

------

## Activity

```js
activity = playing minecraft;
```

Activity is the activity you want the bot to show up as. In this example, `playing` is the type, which has to be `playing`, `streaming`, `listening`, or `watching`. `minecraft` is the name of the activity. Once again, you can not put quotation marks around anything in activity.

This is how it will show up in the bot's status:  <img src="https://github.com/ThatError404/DPL/blob/master/DPL-ActivityExample.png?raw=true" width="100">

------

## Ready

```js
ready;
```

This is the code that makes the bot connect to discord. This is neccecary for activity and running the bot.
